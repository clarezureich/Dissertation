# Capital Allocation in UK Social Impact Bonds:
Sectoral Patterns and Investor Influence – Code & Data

This repository contains the code and data used to analyze funding patterns across UK Social Impact Bonds (SIBs) as part of my dissertation research.

**The project is organized into two main folders:**

## **[Data Sources](./Data%20Sources)**
This folder contains:
- Data outputs generated by the code scripts.
- Supplementary datasets collected from external sources.
- `update_log.csv`, which documents all changes made when integrating the INDIGO Impact Bond Database output with supplementary datasets.

## **[Code Scripts](./Code%20Scripts)**
This folder contains the Python scripts used to collect, process, and analyze the data.  
**Run the scripts in the following order:**
1. [`api_code.py`](./Code%20Scripts/api_code.py) – Extracts SIB project data from the INDIGO Impact Bond Database.
2. [`add_supplementary.py`](./Code%20Scripts/add_supplementary.py) – Integrates additional data from external sources.
3. [`model.py`](./Code%20Scripts/model.py) – Runs the statistical models and generates outputs for analysis.
