This code and data analyzes the funding patterns of UK Social Impact Bonds.
The Code Scripts folder contains the code scripts run to collect and analyze the data. The code must be run in the correct order: 1) api_code.py, 2) add_supplementary.py, 3) model.py. 
The Data Sources folder contains the data outputs from the code scripts, as well as the supplementary data collected from external sources. The update_log.csv records the changes made when combining the INDIGO Impact Bond Database output with the data collected from external sources.
