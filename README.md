# UK Social Impact Bond Funding Patterns – Code & Data

This repository contains the code, data, and outputs from my Master’s dissertation, which examines capital allocation patterns across UK Social Impact Bonds (SIBs).  
The analysis uses a custom-compiled dataset and a Gamma Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to explore how funding varies across policy sectors, and what this reveals about investor priorities.

## **[Data Sources](./Data%20Sources)**
This folder contains:
- Data outputs generated by the code scripts.
- Supplementary datasets collected from external sources.
- `update_log.csv`, which documents all changes made when integrating the INDIGO Impact Bond Database output with supplementary datasets.

---

## **[Code Scripts](./Code%20Scripts)**
This folder contains the Python scripts used to collect, process, and analyze the data.

**Run the scripts in the following order:**
1. [`api_code.py`](./Code%20Scripts/api_code.py) – Extracts SIB project data from the INDIGO Impact Bond Database.
2. [`add_supplementary.py`](./Code%20Scripts/add_supplementary.py) – Integrates additional data from external sources.
3. [`model.py`](./Code%20Scripts/model.py) – Runs the statistical models and generates outputs for analysis.

## **[Figures](./Figures)**
This folder contains key visual outputs from the dissertation analysis.  
Example figures include:
- **Sector Funding Distributions**
